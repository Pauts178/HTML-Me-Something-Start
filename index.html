            <h2>Education:</h2>
            <p>In 2002, I graduated from high school and embarked on the higher education portion of the professional journey. 
               To this day, I continue to seek out educational opportunities...you're never too old to learn new things.
            </p>
               <h3>Truman State University</h3>
                  <img src="images/TSU.jpg" alt="TSU Logo">
                  <p id="undergrad">In 2002 I ventured to the big bustling metropolis of Kirksville, MO
                     to attend Truman State University for my undergrad education. I spent
                     a pretty fantastic 4 1/2 years in Kirksville, getting my bachelors of 
                     science in Criminal Justice Systems. </p>
               <h3>St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department Academy</h3>
                  <img class="right"src="images/SLMPD.jpg" alt="SLMPD Logo">
                  <p id="academy">I was not one of those people who knew what their life and career would look 
                     like from the get-go...and frankly, I'm still not that person. I chose to put 
                     in an application with the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department because it 
                     seemed like a large enough department that I would be able to find my niche. I 
                     started the police academy in June of 2006 and learned a wealth of knowledge and 
                     skills in the eight month span of the academy, as well as meeting some of my best 
                     friends to this day. </p>
               <h3>University of Florida</h3>
                  <img class="left" src="images/UofF.jpg" alt="UofF Gator">
                  <p>Covid brought about challenges for everyone. For me, not being able to be around 
                     my people, friends and family, was my greatest struggle, but it also left me with 
                     some extra time on my hands. I had been looking a the forensic science graduate 
                     program at University of Florida for a significant length of time, but when I realized 
                     they had dropped the GRE requirement, I took that as my sign to pull to trigger and go 
                     back to school. From January of 2021 to December of 2023, I completed online coursework 
                     to obtain a Masters of Science in Pharmarcy with a focus on Forensic Science.  </p>

                  <p>And finally, since I have established that you are never to old to learn, I am in my 
                     early forties and completely venturing in a new direction with education. I have observed 
                     in over a decade of work in the field of forensic science that web-based applications are 
                     being used by multiple disciplines in the field to aid in doing our jobs better and more 
                     efficiently. For that reason, I want to be in the know. I want to know how these applications 
                     work and want to provide myself the knowledge to get involved in web-development that can better 
                     he field of forensic science.  </p>

            <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
               <p> Since February of 2008, I have been a commissioned police officer for the 
                  City of St. Louis. I have worn a number 
                  of hats as a police officer, but most of my career has 
                  been spent in some division of the Crime Laboratory.</p>
               <h3>Patrol Officer</h3>
                  <img src="images/family.jpg" alt="Police Academy Graduation">
                  <p>In February of 2008, I graduated from the police academy 
                     and began my career as a police officer in Central Patrol, 
                     the 4th District of the City of St. Louis. I spent approximately 
                     three and a half years patroling the streets of downtown St. Louis 
                     and got to know the many of the characters that inhabit the area. I 
                     learned a lot about myself and others in those three plus years, but 
                     what I really determined was that being a beat officer was not the best 
                     use of my skills and knowledge. When a position opened up, I applied for 
                     a spot in the crime scene unit and in 2011 I got the call the I would be 
                     transfered to the crime lab. </p>
               <h3>Evidence Technician</h3>
                  <img src="images/scene.jpg" alt="Crime Scene">
                  <p>Patrol had some fun shifts, and also some not so fun shifts, but when 
                     I was transferred to the lab is when I really began to thrive. The summer 
                     of 2011 is when I began to learn about the ins and outs of the crime lab 
                     and crime scene processing. I learned how to document crime scenes using 
                     photographs and notes including measurements and sketches to aid in the 
                     process and how to properly search for and collect evidence. I completed 
                     rigorous training, both in the lab and with outside workshops regarding 
                     crime scene processing and specialized crime scene photography. For several 
                     months, I did field training with two of the most experianced Evidence Technicians 
                     in our unit and Christmas day of 2011 was my first day on my own as trained crime 
                     scene investigator. I spent six very exciting and often exhausting years in the Evidence 
                     Technician Unit and remain proficient in crime scene investigation to this day. I have 
                     provided testimony in numerous cases regarding my role as an Evidence Technician  </p>
               <h3>Firearms Examiner</h3>

                  <img src="images/scope.jpg" alt="Microscopic Photograph">
                  <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">In 2017 an opportunity presented itself that was too good to pass up. I was given 
                     to opportunity to broaden my skills and knowledge in the lab by training to be a 
                     firearms examiner so I took a leap of faith and have been in that section since. 
                     I completed two years of training in the section involving microscopy, firearms 
                     identification, firearms safety, serial number restoration, and ballistic identification 
                     and comparision. After completing training, I completed a comprehensive competency exam 
                     prior to being able to conduct casework.  </p>
