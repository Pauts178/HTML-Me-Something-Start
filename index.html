            <h2>Education:</h2>
            <p>In 2002, I graduated from high school and embarked on the higher education portion of the professional journey. 
               To this day, I continue to seek out educational opportunities...you're never too old to learn new things.

               <p> Since February of 2008, I have been a commissioned police officer for the 
                  City of St. Louis. I have worn a number 
                  of hats as a police officer, but most of my career has 
                  been spent in some division of the Crime Laboratory.</p>
